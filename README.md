## DCOS as a Docker Container

This remains as documentation for a project over the summer of 2016 as I was trying to take the Mesosphere DCOS platform
and make it more portable. This is an older revision of what I evenually deployed but I decided that rather than invest
time and energy into this project and make DCOS more useable I would work on a better platform management product and address
the deficiencies of DCOS.
